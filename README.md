Got it — thanks for the clarification. If you're not using **Flask** and are instead using **`psutil`** (likely for system monitoring or metrics), then the project is more likely a **desktop or script-based ML utility**, not a web app.

Here’s the corrected and relevant version of your `README.md` for the `Mental_Health_Prediction` repository:

# 🧠 Mental Health Prediction

A machine learning-based Python project that predicts mental health status based on survey data. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, model serialization, and local deployment using Python scripts.

## 📦 Requirements

Install required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Typical dependencies include:

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* `joblib`
* `psutil`
* `matplotlib` (if plotting is used)
* `seaborn` (optional for visualization)

> Create a `requirements.txt` with:
> `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source**: The `survey.csv` file contains survey responses about mental health in the workplace.
* **Attributes** include: Age, Gender, Work Environment, Mental Health History, Family Background, etc.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

Trained and evaluated several ML algorithms:

* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Random Forest
* Stacking Classifier

Models are saved (`.sav` format) using `joblib` for efficient reuse.

## 🚀 How to Run

To make a prediction:

```bash
python app.py
```

The script will:

1. Load the trained model.
2. Use `psutil` to optionally monitor system resources.
3. Predict outcomes based on sample or user-provided input.

## ⚙️ psutil Usage

The project uses `psutil` to monitor system performance (CPU/memory usage) during model loading or prediction, useful for profiling or system-aware deployment.

## 📈 Model Performance

Include metrics (manually or in your notebook) like:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* Confusion Matrix

## 🧪 Notebook

You can explore and modify the model pipeline using:

```bash
project.ipynb
```

It includes EDA, preprocessing steps, training procedures, and model evaluation.
